user-interface bugs:
  * shortcut Ctrl-P (reparsing) is not visible in Menu

code improvements:
  * remove dependency on glade since it is deprecated
  * Add module descriptions (haddock)
  * rename type SrcLocation to SrcSpan
  * NodeType could also be a boolean 'isIdentifier'
  * add tests for languages haskell and python. more general:
    how to test your newly defined language?
  * name smallestSrcLocContainingCursorPos suggests something different.
    Better: findAssociatedSubtree (or a path to it)

feature requests:
  * for parsers which return errors with position information:
    somehow use the position information, e.g. jump to erroneous position
  * open/close all subtrees
  * generate pdf/png graphs from trees or terms
  * manual parser selection (adjust documentation of Language)
  * flag to disable flattening lists of chars to one node?
    (not sure if this is really useful)
  * propagate source locations to successors: i.e. nodes "Ident" are annotated
    with a src loc, but their successor in the ast (the actual ident value) is not
    annotated with a location. Can this be generalized?
  * implement searching idents and operations (in the ast)
  * display of raw ast could be valuable
  * when jumping to a path the other trees should be collapsed
